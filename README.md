# Hand-Gesture-project
This project focuses on hand gesture detection using the MediaPipe library and OpenCV in Python.
The goal is to track hand landmarks and detect various hand gestures in real-time using a webcam.

The main steps of the project are as follows:
--> Hand Detection and Landmark Tracking
--> Landmark Extraction
--> Gesture Recognition
--> Real-time Gesture Detection

This project demonstrates the implementation of hand gesture detection using MediaPipe and OpenCV.
It provides a foundation for recognizing various hand gestures in real-time and can be extended to
incorporate additional gestures or integrate with other applications requiring gesture-based interactions.
